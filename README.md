# LotR Mod Translations Updater
Updater program for translations of the LotR Mod for Minecraft 1.15.2. This updater only works with the Renewed edition of the mod (aka with .json files), it will not work for the Legacy (1.7.10) edition.

# How to use
In order to make this program work, you need to have it in a directory along with **3** files:
* Your old translation file, named with the suffix `_old`, as in `fr_fr_old.json`
* The old `en_us.json`, renamed `en_us_old.json`
* The new `en_us.json`, renamed `en_us_new.json`

Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions, and you're done.
